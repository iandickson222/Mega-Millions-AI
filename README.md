# Mega Millions AI
 Mega Millions AI is a LSTM model that attempts to predict future lottery numbers.
 
 ***Mega Millions numbers are drawn from a drawing machine. Therefore, each number has an equal chance of being drawn at any given time. The Mega Millions AI can detect patterns, but it will most likely not win you the lottery. Despite this, feel free to use the AI as a number generator.***
